Niftomation is the project for automating different processes in Indian share market NSE.

I will use NSE rest apis and build a strategy so that I can better analyse share market. This project will help me with decision making.

This allows following items - 

- Command line utility for getting different details of shares
- Automation scripts to fetch and analyse data and perform repetitive tasks.
